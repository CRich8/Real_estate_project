# Reak Estate Market Analysis: Hoboken, NJ (07030)
Due to the rise in prices of houses in New Jersey, I was interested to see if investing in real estate was still a great opportunity for those looking for passive income. I chose Hoboken, New Jersey as the market to analyze because I personally am interested in this city and because it is in high demand both on Zillow and Airbnb. I collected data from multiple sources including Zillow, Airbnb, Realtor.com and Census in order to get an overview of the real estate market from different perspectives.
